# Create a deck of cards which will be shuffled and sorted. 
### Goals:
* Create a “Card” object with fields for “Suit” and “Rank”
* Populate a `List<Card>` with all 52 cards
* Print the size of the deck to the console
* Shuffle the deck
  * Should be in a completely random order that would change every time the program is ran 
* Print the deck of cards to the console
  * Should print with the rank followed by the suit (i.e. FOUR of SPADES) 
* Sort the deck of cards by rank (ignoring suit) and print to the console
  * TWO is the smallest card, ACE is the largest card
* Sort the deck of cards by suit first and then rank; print to the console
  * Similar to opening a fresh pack of cards
